* On the CloudGen WAF GUI go to Basic, Services and create a new service
for your web app. You need to provide: a service name, select the type
and port, and for the moment put a dummy IP (like 1.1.1.1) into the Real
Servers box:

* Once the service and server have created then click "Edit" alongside
the Server that was created. Change the identifier to "Hostname" and
fill in the domain name of your web app into the Hostname field.P-Address:8000

*Cluster for High Availability (HA) and redundancy*

Due to the 24/7 nature of web traffic, it is important that any
deployments in line with the data path have added redundancy. The
Barracuda Web Application Firewalls configured in HA clusters will
automatically synchronize security and network configurations between
the clusters to provide seamless failover in response to disruptions.
This is achieved by creating an autoscaling group of WAF clusters. IF
you are using the BYOL template you will need licenses for the max
number of instances you anticipate on scaling to. For more information
on clustering, see https://campus.barracuda.com/doc/4259911/[High
Availability].

The Barracuda Web Application Firewall provides features to implement
user authentication and access control. You can create a virtual private
network (VPN) tunnel to control user access to websites. The user-access
features allow you to specify who can access your websites and what
access privileges each user has. By combining these with SSL encryption,
you can create a secure VPN tunnel to your websites.

Authentication can be implemented only for HTTP or HTTPS services. The
authentication process requires users to provide a valid name and
password to gain access. A validated user has qualified access to the
website; that is, the data and services this user can access depend on
his or her authorization privileges.
