This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who use WAFs to protect applications
hosted in AWS. Typically, organizations deploy the Barracuda WAF to
protect web-facing applications they are either deploying in or
migrating to AWS. The Barracuda WAF is designed to offer a
highly-configurable set of controls, enabling easier migration and
security for formerly on-premises workloads now deployed in AWS. It
operates as a Reverse Proxy, inspecting traffic in both directions, so
it also provides Data Loss Prevention features.

Please know that we may share who uses AWS Quick Starts with the AWS
Partner Network (APN) Partner that collaborated with AWS on the content
of the Quick Start.
