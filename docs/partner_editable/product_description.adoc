The Barracuda WAF is designed to offer a highly-configurable set of controls, enabling easier migration and security for formerly on-premises workloads that are now deployed in AWS. It operates as a reverse proxy, inspecting traffic in both directions, so it also provides data loss prevention (DLP) features.

The Barracuda WAF runs on the M4 and M5 families of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.
